<!--This file will be used to add exclusions specific to AWS windows servers as well as Splunk Universal forwarder. AWS uses many WMIC commands to get info about the instance running
    All of these commands should be merged into the EventFiltering\ProcessCreate onmatch=exclude section -->

				Ultimately, you must weigh CPU time checking many detailed rules, against the risk of malware exploiting the blindness created.-->
